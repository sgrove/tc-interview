Write a computer program in any language that takes in an xml file describing a list of movies and stores it in a data warehouse. Once the data is loaded, make an interface that returns the number of degrees of separation between two actors. Feel free to specify the xml format yourself or you can just use the one Iâ€™ve given in the example below. Bonus points for solving this problem with a web interface, double bonus points if that interface is built on top of Rails. Remember to comment your code and use consistent naming conventions, and make sure to include a readme file so that I know how to use your program.
